**Date:** 10/16/2025

**Submission Guidelines:** Your team can work on this together but you all have to get a copy of it and push it to your GitHub repo, main folder/repo htmlCssJavaScript, in a subfolder you will call **"careerResearchProject"**.  This will be just a copy and filled out version of this markdown file.  You're just filling in the questions with your own added text. 


## Introduction

The skills you're learning in this class—programming, databases, web design, and AI/ML—open doors to many different career paths. While you might think "tech job" means one thing, the reality is much more diverse. Some roles focus heavily on writing code, others on analyzing data, and still others on designing user experiences or building intelligent systems.

In this project, you'll research **different career paths** to understand:
- What professionals in these roles actually *do* day-to-day
- What education and skills are required
- What the career outlook and salary ranges look like
- Which aspects of your current coursework connect to each role

Your goal is to explore **3 careers** as a team and compare them to help you think about potential future paths.
