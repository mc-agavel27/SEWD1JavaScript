        //you use let, and const for some variables becouse some attributes about something will never change, such as an id, while others will.

        // Use const for values that won't change
        const birthYear = 2005;  // Your birth year never changes
        const hometown = "Springfield";  // Where you were born doesn't change
        const schoolName = "Central High";
        
        // Use let for values that will change
        let currentYear = 2025;  // The year keeps changing
        let age = 20;  // Your age changes every year
        let grade = 10;  // Your grade changes
        
        // Try to change a const - this will cause an ERROR!
        // birthYear = 2006;  // Uncomment this line to see the error
        
        // Changing let variables is fine
        age = 21;
        grade = 11;
